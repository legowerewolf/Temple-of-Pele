## Setup

1. Grab SFML v2.5.1 32bit for Visual Studio 2015 from [here](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.5.1/). ([direct link](https://www.sfml-dev.org/files/SFML-2.5.1-windows-vc14-32-bit.zip)).
2. Create a folder in the project root named `headers`.
3. Extract the SFML zip into `headers`.

At this point, there should be folders `bin`, `include`, and `lib` (and a few extra) in `(project root)/headers/SFML-2.5.1/`. If that's the case, you're done. Launch Visual Studio, keeping the current settings, and try to build.
